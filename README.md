# Introduction
Light microscopy has been an invaluable tool in biological research, enabling the visualization and analysis of various biological specimens with exceptional detail. However, traditional light microscopy techniques have limitations when it comes to imaging specimens from different angles and maintaining precise temperature conditions. These limitations hinder our ability to explore dynamic cellular processes, investigate complex morphological changes, and observe real-time developmental events accurately.

To address these limitations and advance the capabilities of light microscopy, we introduce iCat, a novel multifunctional accessory that combines several essential features into a single, open-source device. iCat allows researchers to rotate specimens along their axial axis, regulate the temperature within a desired range, provide ample illumination through an integrated LED light source, and capture images using its built-in camera to better navigate through the specimen. This integrated approach overcomes the challenges associated with traditional light microscopy, offering researchers a versatile tool to explore the intricacies of biological systems.  <br>

The ability to capture images and videos of a specimen from multiple angles is essential for comprehensive analysis. iCat incorporates a motorized rotation mechanism that enables controlled and precise specimen rotation along its axial axis. Researchers can program the desired rotation parameters through the device's graphical user interface (GUI) and monitor the rotation progress in real-time. The iCat accessory provides unprecedented flexibility in imaging and studying dynamic processes that require specimen repositioning during time-lapse experiments, such as cell migration or morphogenesis. <br>
## Temperature Control
Maintaining a stable and controlled temperature environment is crucial for studying living specimens. iCat addresses this requirement through an in-built thermometer and a Peltier element. The thermometer constantly monitors the specimen's temperature, while the Peltier element actively regulates the temperature within a specified range. This temperature control feature ensures optimal imaging conditions and facilitates accurate analysis of temperature-sensitive biological processes, including embryonic development. <br>
## Illumination and Camera System
An appropriate and adjustable uniform light source is critical for obtaining images using the internal camera. The intensity of the LED can be adjusted via the GUI and minimizes the need for further external light sources during specimen rotation using the built-in camera. The GUI can control the image resolution, providing researchers with flexibility in controlling camera speed. <br><br>

## Instructions
### Part 1: 3D printing
All 3D-printed parts can be printed using PETG or PLA filaments. To print the chamber, it is recommended to use a transparent material for the first three layers in order to be able to use the transmitted light of a microscope. For the remaining parts, black filament should be used to reduce light reflections. The individual STL and 3MF files and the complete Fusion360 project are in the [3D folder](support/3d). <br>

### Part 2: iCat assembly
To assemble iCat from individual parts, follow the instructions below.
1. Insert all M3 nuts and four neodymium magnets into both 'base' parts. <br>
![alt text](support/media/pics/iCat-3.jpg)
2. Slide the linear guide into the 'base-1', put both 'base' parts together, and secure the connection between them with two M3x6 screws. Attach the 'mounting plate' using two M3x6 screws and secure the linear guide with four M3x5 screws. <br>
![alt text](support/media/pics/iCat-4.jpg)
![alt text](support/media/pics/iCat-6.jpg) <br><br>
3. Fix the 'motor plates' to NEMA motors using eighth M3x4 screws according to the image below. Attach GT2 Pulley to one of the NEMA motor. The pin connections of this NEMA motor need to be oriented vertically. <br>
![alt text](support/media/pics/iCat-5a.jpg) <br><br>

4. Secure the 'motor plates' on the 'base' using M3x4 screws. <br>
![alt text](support/media/pics/iCat-7.jpg) <br><br>
5. Insert three M3 nuts into the 'cargo plate-2' and attach the GT2 Idler to it using a M3x14 screw. Cut 33.5 cm of GT2 Timing Belt and pass it through the idler. Fasten the ends of the belt inside the 'cargo' according to the image below. <br>
![alt text](support/media/pics/iCat-8.jpg) <br><br>
6. Secure the 'cargo' to the Linear Guide Carriage using two M3x4 screws and place the belt on the GT2 Pulley that was previously attached to one of the NEMA motors. Attach the 'cargo plate-2' to the 'cargo plate-1' using prepared screws. Do not overtighten these screws, otherwise the 'base' will bend. <br>
![alt text](support/media/pics/iCat-9.jpg) <br><br>
7. Insert the M3x6 screws into the mounting holes of the Arduino Uno and plug the CNC shield onto the Arduino, ensuring that the pins are properly aligned with the corresponding headers. To adjust micro-stepping (1/16 step), set up the M2 pin of the CNC Shield HIGH by connecting the black jumper caps, as shown in the image below. Attach the DRV8825 Stepper Motor Drivers to the CNC Shield and connect the power supply wires to both the shield and the WAGO terminals. <br>
![alt text](support/media/pics/iCat-10a.jpg)
*NOTE: Before proceeding any further, the voltage reference (V<sub>REF</sub>) that corresponds to the maximum current that will flow to the stepper motors needs to be set. The maximum current of used steeper motors is 1.8 A. To calculate the Vref, use this equation:* <br>
**V<sub>REF</sub> = I<sub>max</sub>/2** <br>
**V<sub>REF</sub> = 1.8/2 = 0.9 V** <br>
*In order to set up the Vref, plug in the Arduino UNO with CNC Shield and the DRV8825 Stepper Motor Drivers to the USB port, connect the negative probe of the multimeter to the GND, connect the positive probe of the multimeter to the screwdriver tip, set the multimeter to DC Voltage measurement, and use the screwdriver to turn the potentiometer until you get the calculated voltage.* <br><br>
8. Similarly to the previous step, interconnect the WAGO terminals with the IRF520 Driver Module using additional power wires. Next, connect the wire end of the first Pigtail Cable Jack to the WAGO terminals. The wire end of the other Pigtail Cable Jack needs to be connected to the IRF520 Driver Module. If needed, crimp the ends of any wires. <br>
![alt text](support/media/pics/iCat-11.jpg) <br><br>

Plug 10 kOhm thermistor, while one of its leads connects it with the resistor. Connect the Male-Female Dupont wire to it. This will be connected to the analog input ('Abort' pin) on the CNC shield later on. The other Dupont wires need to be connected to the other thermistor lead (ground) and to the second resistor lead (5 V). Second, prepare the 'Trigger IN' breadboard by plugging a 4.7 kOhm resistor into it and connecting its terminals to the Male DC connector. Dupont wires will be connected to both of these resistor leads later on (step 14) to the ground and to the analog input ('Hold' pin) on the CNC Shield. Third, plug 10 kOhm potentiometer into the last breadboard. Two Dupont wires will be connected to the side and the middle terminals later on, connecting it to PWM digital input ('Step Y' pin of the CNC shield) and to the IRF520 Driver Module signal input. If needed, crimp the ends of any wires. <br>
