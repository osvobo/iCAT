# Abstract:
In the field of light microscopy, imaging specimens from multiple angles and maintaining controlled temperature conditions are crucial for comprehensive and accurate analysis. To address these challenges, we present iCat, an open-source multifunctional accessory designed to revolutionize light microscopy capabilities. iCat enables the rotation of specimens along their axial axis, incorporates an in-built thermometer and Peltier element for precise temperature control, features an integrated LED light source, and is equipped with a camera. This versatile device, controlled by an Arduino-based electronic circuit and a Processing based graphical user interface (GUI), allows researchers to capture detailed images and videos of both fixed and live specimens, such as C. Elegans, Zebrafish, Drosophila, mouse embryos etc. The iCat accessory, which can be easily 3D printed and assembled using readily available electrical components, serves as a powerful tool for investigating dynamic cellular processes and complex developmental phenomena.
# Introduction
Light microscopy has been an invaluable tool in biological research, enabling the visualization and analysis of various biological specimens with exceptional detail. However, traditional light microscopy techniques have limitations when it comes to imaging specimens from different angles and maintaining precise temperature conditions. These limitations hinder our ability to explore dynamic cellular processes, investigate complex morphological changes, and observe real-time developmental events accurately.

To address these limitations and advance the capabilities of light microscopy, we introduce iCat, a novel multifunctional accessory that combines several essential features into a single, open-source device. iCat allows researchers to rotate specimens along their axial axis, regulate the temperature within a desired range, provide ample illumination through an integrated LED light source, and capture images using its built-in camera to better navigate through the specimen. This integrated approach overcomes the challenges associated with traditional light microscopy, offering researchers a versatile tool to explore the intricacies of biological systems.
# Design and Functionality
## Rotational Capabilities
The ability to capture images and videos of a specimen from multiple angles is essential for comprehensive analysis. iCat incorporates a motorized rotation mechanism that enables controlled and precise specimen rotation along its axial axis. Researchers can program the desired rotation parameters through the device's graphical user interface (GUI) and monitor the rotation progress in real-time. The iCat accessory provides unprecedented flexibility in imaging and studying dynamic processes that require specimen repositioning during time-lapse experiments, such as cell migration or morphogenesis.
## Temperature Control
Maintaining a stable and controlled temperature environment is crucial for studying living specimens and preserving the integrity of fixed samples. iCat addresses this requirement through an in-built thermometer and a Peltier element. The thermometer constantly monitors the specimen's temperature, while the Peltier element actively regulates the temperature within a specified range. This temperature control feature ensures optimal imaging conditions and facilitates accurate analysis of temperature-sensitive biological processes, including embryonic development and cellular reactions.
## Illumination and Camera System
An appropriate and adjustable uniform light source is critical for obtaining images using internal camera. The intensity of the LED can be adjusted via the GUI and minimizes the need for external light sources during specimen rotation using in-built camera. The camera's parameters, such as exposure time and image resolution, can be controlled through the GUI, providing researchers with flexibility and customization options.
# Fabrication and Accessibility
One of the key advantages of iCat is its open-source nature, which promotes accessibility, customization, and collaborative development. The device can be fabricated using 3D printing technology, ensuring low-cost production and ease of assembly. Additionally, all the electrical components required for iCat can be readily obtained for less than $300, making it feasible for researchers with varying resources and expertise levels to replicate and utilize the device in their laboratories. The control circuit, based on the Arduino platform, is well-documented and can be modified to accommodate specific experimental requirements.
# Applications and Impact
The multifunctional capabilities of iCat open up new avenues for biological research, particularly in the fields of developmental biology, neurobiology, and cellular imaging. By enabling precise specimen rotation, temperature control, illumination, and imaging, iCat empowers researchers to investigate dynamic processes, observe intricate morphological changes, and capture real-time developmental events. The device has proven particularly effective in the study of model organisms such as C. elegans, Zebrafish, where cell migration, organogenesis, and tissue development necessitate the ability to reposition specimens during time-lapse experiments.
Furthermore, the open-source nature of iCat fosters collaboration and encourages the scientific community to contribute to its development and enhancement. By sharing the design, software, and documentation, we aim to accelerate scientific progress and provide a versatile tool that can be adapted and customized for specific research needs.
# Conclusion
iCat represents a significant advancement in light microscopy, addressing the limitations of traditional techniques by offering a multifunctional accessory that combines rotation, temperature control, illumination, and imaging capabilities. The open-source nature of iCat ensures its accessibility, affordability, and adaptability, making it an invaluable tool for researchers in the biological sciences. By providing a platform to investigate dynamic processes and complex developmental phenomena, iCat contributes to our understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms and facilitates discoveries in various fields of study.

## Instructions
### Step 1: 3D printing
Most of the 3D-printed parts need to be printed from PETG or PLA. To print the chamber, it is recommended to use a transparent material for the first bottom layers in order to be able to use the transmitted light. Otherwise, it is recommended to use black filament to reduce light reflections. The individual stl and 3mf files for all necessary parts as well as the complete Fusion360 project is [here](support/3d).
