# iCat: A Multifunctional Open-Source Accessory for Advanced Light Microscopy
"i" - Intuitive: iCat represents an innovative approach to light microscopy, incorporating advanced features like controlled axial rotation and tracking. It introduces a novel solution for imaging and studying biological specimens with enhanced capabilities, pushing the boundaries of traditional microscopy techniques.\
"C" - Controlled: iCat offers precise control over specimen rotation, temperature regulation, and lighting conditions, ensuring optimal imaging conditions and experimental reproducibility.\
"a" - Axial: iCat's unique capability to rotate specimens along their axial axis sets it apart from conventional light microscopy techniques, allowing researchers to observe dynamic processes and capture detailed time-lapse sequences.\
"t" - Tilt: iCat enables precise tracking of specimens during imaging experiments. By combining controlled axial rotation and advanced imaging capabilities, researchers can accurately track and monitor specific features or regions of interest within the specimen over time.\
